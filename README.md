# react-apollo Issue #660

This repository reproduces the issue described here:

https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/660

**Note:** When the changes made in this branch are applied on the latest version of the `react-apollo-error-template` that uses `v2` of `react-apollo` (as done in commit [2612fada](https://github.com/newoga/react-apollo-issue-660/tree/2612fada87987701d33e53cd7d877e85209beab6)), this issue goes away. Version 2 of `react-apollo` appears to contain rewritten internals of several core components that resolve the original problem described in issue [#660](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/660
).
